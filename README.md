Hello!, feeling degraded today :) suicidal thoughts take over my night
What can I do about it except document, if anything happens I'll write it 
Here, I love you!

Hey, feeling lost today, I got an apology and officially with my S.O. I've been
Struggling with my personality, wishing to be another person in whole and having
Totally different personalities with people, wish it wasn't like that, my suicidal
Thoughts have lessened and one of my friends cared, I have to be quiet now, I don't
Think anyone should care <3 
Goodnight, I love you!
